> My name is John. I am a student who started an e-commerce startup business named "DummyExample" with my partner, James. Initially, I was using WordPress and shared hosting. After experiencing good traffic, I decided to migrate from WordPress to a customized website on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Currently, my partner and I are working on the website, contributing to a Gitea server hosted on GCP. I migrated all customer data to cloud storage. Recently, my data was breached, and I have no clue how it happened or what was vulnerable. My GCP infrastructure consists of five VM instances and a single Cloud Storage. There is one Windows machine for my partner to use, with very restricted permissions over GCP, only allowing access to his Gitea account. I have two Linux machines for my work, one for hosting the Gitea server and another for packet mirroring. All the machines have public IPs but very restricted access due to firewalls in place. Due to budget constraints, I can't use the Google Security Command Center service, so I am providing you with the VPC network traffic capture and the Google Cloud logs.<br>

Challenge provided a pcap files: `NetworkTraffic.pcap`<br>
